# LoRa_Manual
Code relevant to an User Manual for LoRa/LoRaWAN devices (RAK831, RAK811, Dragino v1.3 LoRa Shield) done as an extracurricular project.

* 'lmic_project_config.h' the personalized config file for the code relevant to the User Manual, done as per the README.md found at the [https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic](MCCI repo)
* 'basicABPtest_lora.ino' a "Hello, world!" test file, adapted from the [https://wiki.dragino.com/index.php?title=Lora_Shield](Dragino wiki page). I adjoined a case in the event handler to await printing "Unknown event", set the data rate at SF7, and provided extensive comments explaining the code.
