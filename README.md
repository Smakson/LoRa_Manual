# LoRa_Manual
Code relevant to an User Manual for LoRa/LoRaWAN devices (RAK831, RAK811, Dragino v1.3 LoRa Shield) done as an extracurricular project.

* 'lmic_project_config.h' the personalized config file for the code relevant to the User Manual, done as per the "README.md" found at the [MCCI repo](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic). TESTED AND WORKING.
* 'basicABPtest_lora.ino' a `"Hello, world!"` test file, adapted from the [Dragino wiki page](https://wiki.dragino.com/index.php?title=Lora_Shield). I adjoined a case in the event handler to avoid printing "Unknown event" and provided extensive comments explaining the code. TESTED AND WORKING.
* 'loraABPsensor.ino' a basic sensor application, which extends the above example to include a `do_scan` function. Since I did not posses a sensor, it generates random bytes of data and stores them in an array. When the array is full it is transmitted. More info in the comments. TESTED AND WORKING.
* 'lowpower_lora.ino' an extension of the sensor application which takes inspiration from the [Low Power](https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power/blob/master) library as well as [this example](https://github.com/DiederikRhee/ProMini_Lora_Otaa_temperture/blob/master/Lora_temp_hum/Lora_temp_hum.ino) to illustrate what a sensor would look like if one wished to conserve power. Keep in mind the Low Power library needs to be installed/imported so that the code will run. UNTESTED.
* 'basicMQTT.py' simple example of how to use the MQTT API to communicate with TTN, requires the [paho-mqtt library](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/). TESTED AND WORKING.
* 'basicDjango' a [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) project, defining a basic web app allowing one to view the messages from the above 'sensor' and communicate back to it. It uses both the MQTT API as well as the [Storage Integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/) to make sure all the messages are up-to-date. The admin page allows for messages to be deleted by people with verified credentials and the database allows for permanent storage otherwise. Requires paho-mqtt and Django. For instruction how to run or if unfamiliar refer to the above link. TESTED AND WORKING.
* 'downlink.ino' an extended application for the 'lowpower_lora.ino' which now accepts downlink messages that define it's sample rate and size of the buffer in which it keeps its measurements. The Django app supports this with relevant fields. UNTESTED.
* 'LoRA_UserManual' the actual "User Manual" mentioned above.
